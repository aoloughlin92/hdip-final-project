## Wedoo - An Event Planning App

Wedoo is an event planning web application. Wedoo is built using the Hapi framework and a handlebars front end. The app is targeted at wedding planning but can be used for all types of events. The application includes a PayPal donation function to allow guests to donate to fundraisers they are attending or to send a gift to a couple getting married. Wedoo also includes guestlist management functionality which consists of electronic RSVPs and optional Excel file upload. Wedoo allows hosts to automatically send email requests to guests to add their information or RSVP.
